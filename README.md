Exercise to learn implementation of Linked List and associated methods using 
JS Classes

Coincidentally, finally understand setters and getters and why it's helpful to 
protect the internal data that way, plus why _variables are used here.

TODO 

Sort method

Could change so only LList class need be exported ? Can a module use interior unexported classes?
