Exercise to learn implementation of Linked List and associated methods using 
JS Classes

Coincidentally, finally understand setters and getters and why it's helpful to 
protect the internal data that way, plus why _variables are used here.

## Issues 

> multiple nodes can contain the same refference to an object 
> Index may only find obj refference, can it work with value too? Maybe with optional params?

> TODO 

> reference safety to add methods

## Add pass around objects as data and see what breaks

> Sort method

> Could change so only LList class need be exported ? Can a module use interior unexported classes?
